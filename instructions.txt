Syncing a fork

Sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.

1. Change the current working directory to your local project.
2. Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to BRANCHNAME will be stored in the local branch upstream/BRANCHNAME.
   git fetch upstream
3. git checkout main
4. git merge upstream/main


Merging an upstream repository into your fork

If you don't have push (write) access to an upstream repository, then you can pull commits from that repository into your own fork.

1. Change the current working directory to your local project.
2. git checkout main
3. git pull https://github.com/nebblu/ML_unige.git main
4. commit
5. git push origin main
